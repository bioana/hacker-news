### Boilerplate (Nuxt / Dependencies)

- `nuxt.config.ts`: Generated with `npm create nuxt`
- `.nuxt/`: Entirely generated by Nuxt.
- Usage of `useFetch` : Nuxt 3 built-in composables.
- `app.vue` – Base Nuxt app layout file
- `tsconfig.json` – Standard TypeScript config for Nuxt projects.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` – Dependencies auto-generated when setting up project.

### Original code

-`composables/states.ts` – Custom state logic -`pages/stories/index.vue` – Custom page for dysplaying the stories grid -`pages/stories/[id].vue` – Dynamic page to show individual story details. -`types/index.ts` – Custom TypeScript types defined for Story model. -`public/image.jpg` – Custom asset added manually.

### Notes

This project pulls a list of top stories from the Hacker News API, selects 10 random stories, fetches detailed information for each one, and then renders them in a responsive grid layout, implemented using semantic HTML and CSS grid for responsive design.
